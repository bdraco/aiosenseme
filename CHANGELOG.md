# Changelog for aiosenseme library

## v0.6.0

* Drop support for EOL python 3.6
* Add support for setting smart mode thanks to @barlock

## v0.5.5

* Improve startup time when initially connecting to device.

## v0.5.4

* Fix error caused by adding timeout in v0.5.3.

## v0.5.3

* Added timeout in listener task to better detect when fans are offline.

## v0.5.2

* Fix partial status message from device causing listener task to exit from an unhandled exception. Once this happened the device would be deaf to status updates.

## v0.5.1

* This version should not be used. It has a serious regression that is fixed in v0.5.2.
* Determine a callback type (coroutine or function) only when adding the callback. The reduces overhead in callbacks.
* Callbacks are stopped when the device is waiting for the first update and can only occur when a parameter has changed. Callback frequency has been significantly reduced.
* Thanks go to [bdraco](https://github.com/bdraco) for help in making these changes.

## v0.5.0

* Devices can now be added with an IP address instead of being discovered. Some network configurations will not allow UDP Discovery packets through but a direct TCP connection will work.
* Add support for locating a fan by IP address in the command line.
* Added additional error checking on Discovery listener sockets.
* Changed the reconnect logic slightly. SensemeDevice will now force an update of all parameters when reconnected.
* API breaking changes.
  * In the SensemeDevice constructor the 'id' parameter changed to 'mac, 'ip' is now 'address', and 'model' is now 'base_model'.
  * SensemeFan.fan_whoosh property is now SensemeFan.fan_whoosh_mode.
  * SensemeDevice.id property has been removed. Use SensemeDevice.mac property instead.
  * SensemeDevice.motion_sensor property changed to SensemeDevice.motion_detected.
* API additions
  * SensemeDevice.get_device_info property returns a dictionary with key SenseME device information.
  * SensemeDevice constructor now has an 'info' parameter. You can use the dict obtained from SensemeDevice.get_device_info property.
  * SensemeDevice.available property indicates when the device is connected and the first parameter update is complete.
  * SensemeDevice.mac property gets the MAC address of the device.
  * SensemeDevice.uuid property gets the Network Token (UUID) obtained from the device.
  * SensemeDevice.base_model property gets the model of the device as returned by the device. SensemeDevice.model property gets the prettier formatted model name.
  * SensemeDiscovery.add_by_device_info(info) allows you to add a device by info dict obtained by SensemeDevice.get_device_info. It will be added to the discovery device list just like it was discovered. This works for both fans and lights.
  * SensemeDiscovery.add_by_ip_address(address) allows you to add a device by IP address. It will be added to the discovery device list just like it was discovered. This works for both fans and lights.
  * aiosenseme.async_get_device_by_device_info(info) connects to and returns a device using and info dict obtained by SensemeDevice.get_device_info. This method returns an appropriate SensemeFan or SensemeLight object.
  * aiosenseme.async_get_device_by_ip_address(address) connects to a device via the specified IP address, determines key information and returns an appropriate SensemeFan or SensemeLight object.
  * SensemeFan.sleep_mode property sets/gets the current sleep mode in the device.
  * SensemeFan.fan_speed_limits property. Gets a Tuple of both fan speed minimum and fan speed maximum.
* Command line changes
  * Added -i/--ip option to connect to fans directly without using discovery.
  * Added -j/--json option to output fan information and state as json.
  * -n/--name no longer matches on room name also.

## v0.4.5

* Fix error when cancelling the listener task of a device when stop() is called. Thanks to [briantho](https://github.com/briantho) for bringing this to my attention.

## v0.4.4

* Fix protocol error on Windows and Python 3.7.8 and above. This error prevented discovery of any SenseME devices. Thanks to [briantho](https://github.com/briantho) for bringing this to my attention.

## v0.4.3

* Fix missing occupancy sensor for standalone Haiku Light. Regression caused by v0.4.2.

## v0.4.2

* Detects occupancy sensor for Haiku L fans with attached Wireless Wall Controller.

## v0.4.1

* Fix error discovery logic that treated a rediscovered Haiku Light as a new device.
* Removed some unhelpful discovery debug messages.
* Cleanup the usage of the word fan when device should be used.

## v0.4.0

* Now supports standalone Haiku Light. Thanks to [PenitentTangent2401](https://github.com/PenitentTangent2401) for help in testing and debugging these changes.
* Add ```--listen``` option to command line. This will open a connection to specified device name or IP address and show status information as the fans sends it.

## v0.3.3

* Ignore Wireless Wall Controllers. It appears this library will connect to them and cause lockups requiring a reset.
* Add error logging for unhandled exceptions in SensemeDiscovery._updater() and SensemeFan._listener().

## v0.3.2

* Add H-Series Haiku fan to known model list. Fan reports a slightly different model string for the Haiku Fan.
* Add model list to command line arguments.
* Add exception handling when creating discovery sockets. This should help the issue of a socket error on one network interface preventing discovery from working other network interfaces.

## v0.3.1

* SensemeFan.room_type now reports the room correctly.
* Removed socket option reuse_port for discovery as is appears to not work on MacOS and really isn't needed.
* Discovery no longer listens on loopback interface.

## v0.3.0

* Lots of linting changes.
* API breaking changes.
  * aiosenseme.Discover() is now aiosenseme.discover().
  * aiosenseme.Discover_Any() is now aiosenseme.discover_any().
* aiosenseme.discover() will now match Fan Name, Room Name and IP address.

## v0.2.1

* Requiring Python 3.7 was too restrictive. Back to allowing and testing Python 3.6.

## v0.2.0

* API breaking changes.
  * SensemeFan.group_status() is now SensemeFan.room_status().
  * SensemeFan.group_name() is now SensemeFan.room_name().
  * SensemeFan.group_room_type() is now SensemeFan.room_type().
* Now requiring python 3.7 or above. Not testing on anything lower.
* Add Discover() function to aiosenseme.
* Improved error handling in SensemeDiscovery and some testing on MacOS.
* Handle fan models differently and hopefully better in SensemeFan.
* Added SensemeFan.models() class method which returns an list of known models.
* API Added command line script capability.
* Added Type Hints.

## v0.1.1

* Add L-Series Haiku fan to known model list.

## v0.1.0

* Initial release.
